# Replace in file

This is just a private fork from [adamreisnz/replace-in-file](https://github.com/adamreisnz/replace-in-file) because I had some problems on my MacBook with an error "EMFILE: too many open files" and the easiest and fastest way was to use the library [treygriffith/filequeue](https://github.com/treygriffith/filequeue) instead of "fs".

Therefore for further instructions and help see [adamreisnz/replace-in-file](https://github.com/adamreisnz/replace-in-file)
